## BAD PYTHON PROGRAMMING AHHHHHH
### planning to touch on:
- __*IMPORTANT PYTHON INFO: SYNTAX IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT, BUT INDENTATION IS INSANELY IMPORTANT*__
- how to run python in the terminal
- print() command
- declaring variables + variable types (integer, string, list, constants??)
  - creating an empty variable
- math in python + string concatenation (make sure to mention incompatiable variable types)
  - all mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- if, if ... else, elif statements
  - all relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
  - all logical operators (and, or, not)
- loops (for and while)
  - range??
- lists + indexes
  - appending, removing, inserting items into lists
- additional topics:
  - conversion of variable types (integer, strings, bytes)
  - very basic pwntools tutorials
  - finding length of lists
