## RUNNING PYTHON IN THE TERMINAL (+ YOUR FIRST PROGRAM)
I think python is actually an extremely easy language to compile and run, in comparison to languages like `javascript` or *ANY* form of `C` code. But if you haven't figured it out yet ... :O 

Python is available in the terminal in virtually every single computer ~~that you can run League of Legends on~~, BUT if you don't have python or just want to check if you do, type:
```bash
python3 --version
# ... to check for the most recent version of python, but you can still use: 
python --version
# if you're looking for any remnants of python on your computer :)
```
I would tell you how to install python / python3 because they are very easy to download, but I think literally everyone I'm showing this to has python installed somewhere, somehow on their computer, so I'll just leave a link to the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that teaches how to download python on macOS / Windows / Linux (if you're a nerd).  

Create a file that ends in `.py` which runs python script by either using the `touch` keyword on macOS:
``` bash
~ % touch hello.py
```
OR `type nul > hello.txt` replacing the `hello.txt` filename with one that ends in `.py`:
``` c++
C:\Users\username>type nul > hello.py
```
Use `nano` command in command line to inspect/write code to a file:
``` bash
```
Run python in the command line by using `python3`(`python2` / `python` if you want to use a deprecated version of python): 
``` bash
# THIS WORKS UNIVERSALLY!! (i just use macOS because it's my most common machine :))
~ % python3 hello.py
# OR
~ % python2 hello.py
# OR
~ % python hello.py
```
