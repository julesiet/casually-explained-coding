# SYNTAX
One of the **biggest** shifts from any other coding language, whether that be JS or C#, is the syntax rules implemented in Python.
> Some syntax rules will be revisited in later lessons :) 

For example, in javascript, we write:
``` javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```
in order to write a message to the console!  

HOWEVER, in python, we can write, or rather *print*, a message:
``` python
print('Hello World')
```
just like this! Virtually indifferent, but there are some noticeable contrasts between the two.  

Rather than using the `console.log` command, we utilize this `print` command instead which is at the heart of many python programs. But one that you might not have noticed so easily while comparing the two is the [omitting of the semicolon](https://tenor.com/view/ok-bye-gif-24608488).  

Furthermore, python uses an **indentation** coding syntax that allows code to be separate by how many times lines of code can be indented, as show in the example below.
``` python
# it's okay if you don't understand how this code works! it's just an example :)

message = 'Hello World!'
if message == 'Hello World':
    print('Thanks for saying hi :)')
    
# ^^ OH MY GOD IT'S AN INDENT !!!
```
So if you ever get an error in your code when you notice absolutely NOTHING about your code being wrong, always remind yourself:
- I did this to myself and I hate coding.

BUT ALSO!!!
- Please check your syntax. <3
